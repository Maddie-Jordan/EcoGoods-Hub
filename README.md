# EcoGoods-Hub

This is a big UI/UX project for myself, including graphic design using Affinity Designer 2.

This project is for an eco-conscious blog called "EcoGoods Hub". I had ChatGPT give create a client, give me the business details, brand guideline, user stories, and inspiration guide.

I created the logo in Affinity Designer 2, the wireframes and mockups in Figma (along with components and style guide), and I am coding the website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
